Real-Time Chat Application
Build a real-time chat application using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO.

Overview
This project guides you through the process of creating a real-time chat application that enables multiple users to join chat rooms and communicate in real-time. The application will be built using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO for seamless real-time communication.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project and run the chat application:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd real-time-chat-application
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Project Structure
/public: Contains static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the web interface.
/src: Contains server-side logic written in Node.js.
Requirements
Set up Node.js Project
Create a basic Node.js project with Express.js, Socket.IO, and other necessary NPM packages.

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
npm install express socket.io
Create Web Interface
Design a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for users to join chat rooms and send messages.

Implement Server-Side Logic
Use Node.js and Socket.IO to manage chat rooms, user connections, and message broadcasting.

Socket.IO Events
connection: Handle a new user connection.
join: Add a user to a specific chat room.
message: Broadcast a message to all users in a chat room.
disconnect: Handle user disconnections and clean up user data.
Socket.IO Event Listeners (Client-Side)
Implement JavaScript event listeners on the client-side to update the user interface in real-time.

Error Handling
Implement proper error handling for invalid chat room names, user names, and other potential issues.

Testing
Test the chat application using multiple browser instances to simulate multiple users. Ensure that the real-time communication and room management are working seamlessly.
